            <h2>I. Introduction</h2>
            <p>As India intensifies its commitment to renewable energy, understanding the Renewable Purchase Obligations (RPO) set forth by various regulatory bodies becomes crucial. This article delves into the alignment and diversification of RPO trajectories across different states in India, highlighting areas of confusion and offering recommendations for harmonization and clarity.</p>

            <h2>Central Government’s RPO Trajectory</h2>
            <p>The Central Government, via the Ministry of Power, issued a notification on 20.10.2023, outlining RPO targets from 2024 to 2030. The same is in effect from 01.04.2024. These targets are aimed at increasing the share of renewable energy in the national energy mix, emphasizing categories such as Wind Renewable Energy (RE), Hydro RE, Distributed RE, and Other RE.</p>

            <img src="/img/blog1_1.png" alt="India’s Renewable Energy Landscape image" />


            <p>For hilly and North-Eastern States/Union Territories, namely Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura, Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttarakhand, the distributed renewable energy component shall be half of that given in the Table and the remaining component for these States shall be included in the other renewable energy sources.</p>

            <p><strong>Distributed RE as distinct category:</strong> The aforesaid notification has created a new and distinct category wherein the renewable energy component from distributed RE is to be met only from the energy generated from renewable energy projects that are less than 10 MW in size, including solar installations under all configurations (net metering, gross metering, virtual net metering, group net metering, behind-the-meter installations, and any other configuration) as notified by the Central Government.</p>

            <img src="/img/blog1_2.png" alt="India’s Renewable Energy Landscape image" />

            <p>The Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) framework in India is an essential mechanism driving the transition towards a sustainable energy future. However, this notification by the Central Government prescribing RPO targets raises not just significant legal questions, particularly in light of the Electricity Act, 2003, and the Energy Conservation Act, 2001, but also raises implementation issues in view of lack of harmony in prescribing RPO targets.</p>

            <h2>II. Legislative Overlap under Statutory Framework</h2>

            <h3>The Electricity Act, 2003</h3>
            <p>The Electricity Act, 2003, serves as the cornerstone of the regulatory regime governing electricity in India. Pertinent sections of this Act delineate the roles and responsibilities of the Central and State Electricity Regulatory Commissions, particularly:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Section 61:</strong> This section empowers the Appropriate Commission to specify terms and conditions for the determination of tariffs, which includes promoting co-generation and generation of electricity from renewable sources.</li>
                <li><strong>Section 86(1)(e):</strong> It mandates State Commissions to promote co-generation and generation of electricity from renewable sources by providing suitable measures for connectivity with the grid and sale of electricity to any person and to prescribe a percentage of the total consumption of electricity in the area of a distribution licensee for purchase of electricity from such renewable sources.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Energy Conservation Act, 2001</h3>
            <p>The Ministry of Power’s notification invokes clauses (n) and (x) of Section 14 of the Energy Conservation Act, 2001 to prescribe RPO targets for designated consumers. Section 14 provides for power of the Central Government to enforce efficient use of energy. It reads as under:</p>

            <p><strong> 14. Power of Central Government to enforce efficient use of energy and its conservation. - </strong>The Central Government may, by notification in consultation with the Bureau,-</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p><strong>Clause (n):</strong> direct every designated consumer to comply with energy consumption norms and standards;</p>
                <p><strong>Clause (x):</strong> specify minimum share of consumption of non-fossil sources by designated consumers as energy or feedstock, provided different share of consumption may be specified for different types of non-fossil sources for different designated consumers.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>

It may be noted that Clause (x) was introduced under the Energy Conservation Act, 2001 by virtue of an amendment being the Energy Conservation (Amendment) Act, 2022 published in the official gazette on 20.12.2022. Though the primary objective of the Energy Conservation Act is to promote energy efficiency and conservation, the newly introduced Clause (x), while tangentially related to energy conservation by promoting renewable energy, focuses more on the generation and procurement aspect of electricity, a domain categorically reserved for the Electricity Act, 2003. Further, when the identical subject matter is already covered under a separate legislative enactment, the insertion of Clause (x) under Section 14 of the Energy Conservation Act, 2001 amounts to encroaching and usurping the mandate given to State Commissions. The aforesaid situation has created a direct conflict between two central enactments and more over it creates a confusion/ regulatory uncertainty which would be counter-productive for not only the obligated entities but also the prospective investors.</p>

<p>
It is also pertinent to mention that in addition to the above conflict between two central enactments that exist as elucidated hereinabove, the confusion is perpetuated by yet another policy document issued by Central Government, namely, the National Tariff Policy, 2016 under Section 3 of the Electricity Act, 2003. Under the National Tariff Policy, 2016, in particular, under Clause 6.4(1), it provides that it is the Ministry of Power which will prescribe the RPO trajectory in consultation with Ministry of New and Renewable Energy. The relevant portion is extracted as under:</p>

<h2>“6.4 Renewable sources of energy generation including Co-generation from renewable energy sources:<h2/>

<p>(1) Pursuant to provisions of section 86(1)(e) of the Act, the Appropriate Commission shall fix a minimum percentage of the total consumption of electricity in the area of a distribution licensee for purchase of energy from renewable energy sources, taking into account availability of such resources and its impact on retail tariffs. Cost of purchase of renewable energy shall be taken into account while determining tariff by SERCs. Long term growth trajectory of Renewable Purchase Obligations (RPOs) will be prescribed by the Ministry of Power in consultation with MNRE.” [Underline Supplied]</p>

<p>Even internally, the Ministry of Power has not been consistent in prescribing RPO trajectory, inasmuch as it has vide its earlier Notification dated 22.07.2022 prescribed following trajectory, which is at variance with the trajectory notified vide Notification dated 20.10.2023 under the Energy Conservation Act, 2001:</p>

            <img src="/img/blog1_3.png" alt="India’s Renewable Energy Landscape image" />

<p>The graph below displays the variance between the differing RPO targets as notified by Ministry of Power:</p>

            <img src="/img/blog1_4.png" alt="India’s Renewable Energy Landscape image" />

<ul>
    <li><strong>Wind Variance:</strong> Increases from 1.79% in 2024-25 to 3.46% in 2029-30.</li>
    <li><strong>Hydro Variance:</strong> Begins at 0.70% in 2024-25 and increases to 1.49% in 2029-30.</li>
    <li><strong>Distributed RE Variance:</strong> Shows a negative variance since Distributed RE targets are not included in the RPO data, starting at -1.50% in 2024-25 and decreasing further to -4.50% in 2029-30.</li>
    <li><strong>Other Variance:</strong> The difference between Other RPO and Other RE targets starts at -0.98% in 2024-25 and improves slightly to -0.45% in 2029-30.</li>
    <li><strong>Total Variance:</strong> Remains zero, as the total RPO perfectly matches the total RE targets for each year.</li>
</ul>

<p>The above overlap necessitates judicial intervention, at the very least, to clarify the law and implementation on the subject.</p>



            <h2>III. Cacophony of RPO Targets</h2>

            <h3>A. State Commissions alignment with Central Government Trajectory</h3>
            <p>State Commissions which have aligned their RPO trajectories with the Central Government’s targets, ensuring consistency and ease of compliance, are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission:</strong> Completely aligned with the Central Government’s RPO targets.</li>
                <li><strong>Jharkhand State Electricity Regulatory Commission (JSERC):</strong> Fully aligned with Central Government targets from 2024-25 to 2029-30.</li>
                <li><strong>Joint Electricity Regulatory Commission for the UT of Jammu & Kashmir and UT of Ladakh:</strong> Aligned with the MoP Notification dated 20.10.2023.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>B. States with Diversified RPO Trajectories</h3>
            <p><strong>Some states have adopted distinct RPO trajectories, reflecting regional priorities and strategies:</strong></p>
            
                <p><strong>Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission (RERC):</strong> Differentiated category-wise targets despite aligning total RPO targets.</p>

            <img src="/img/blog1_5.png" alt="India’s Renewable Energy Landscape image" />

                <p><strong>Differs on category wise trajectory:</strong> While the total RPO targets are aligned with that of Central Government trajectory, category wise trajectories differs.</p>

                <p><strong>Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission:</strong> Category-wise trajectories differ while total RPO targets align with Central Government.</p>

            <img src="/img/blog1_6.png" alt="India’s Renewable Energy Landscape image" />

                 <p><strong>Differs on category wise trajectory:</strong> While the total RPO targets are aligned with that of Central Government trajectory, category wise trajectories differs.</p>

                <p><strong>Madhya Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (MPERC):</strong> Higher initial Wind RE targets and unique category splits.</p>
          
            <img src="/img/blog1_7.png" alt="India’s Renewable Energy Landscape image" />

<ul>
    <li><strong>Wind RE:</strong> Higher initial targets compared to the Central Government.</li>
    <li><strong>Hydro RE:</strong> Different specific targets.</li>
    <li><strong>Other RE:</strong> Unique percentage allocations.</li>
    <li><strong>Total RE:</strong> Consistently increasing but with different category splits.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>B.4 Odisha Electricity Regulatory Commission (OERC):</strong> Vide Odisha Electricity Regulatory Commission (Procurement of Energy from Renewable Sources and its Compliance) Regulations, 2021 dated 17.01.2022, it provided RPO targets as under:</p>

            <img src="/img/blog1_8.png" alt="India’s Renewable Energy Landscape image" />


<ul>
    <li><strong>Separate Solar RE category:</strong> Reflecting a focus on solar energy.</li>
    <li><strong>Non-Solar and Hydro RE:</strong> Specific, differentiated targets.</li>
</ul>



<p>Though OERC has issued a Draft Amendment in its RPO Regulations, 2021 aligning itself with trajectory of Central Government’s earlier notification dated 22.07.2022.</p>

<p><strong>B.5. Uttarakhand Electricity Regulatory Commission (UERC):</strong> Vide Uttarakhand Electricity Regulatory Commission (Tariff and Other Terms for Supply of Electricity from Renewable Energy Sources and non-fossil fuel based Co-generating Stations) Regulations, 2023 dated 16.08.2023, it provided RPO targets as under:</p>

            <img src="/img/blog1_9.png" alt="India’s Renewable Energy Landscape image" />

<p><strong>Distinct targets for Wind, Hydro, Solar, and Other RPO:</strong> Different incremental increases compared to the Central Government targets with overall RPO targets in alignment.
</p>


<p><strong>B.6. Telangana State Electricity Regulatory Commission (TSERC):</strong> Vide Telangana State Electricity Regulatory Commission Renewable Power Purchase Obligation (Compliance by Purchase of Renewable Energy/Renewable Energy Certificate) Regulation, 2022 dated 04.04.2022, it notified RPO targets as under:</p>

            <img src="/img/blog1_10.png" alt="India’s Renewable Energy Landscape image" />


<p><strong>Separate Solar and Non-Solar RPO categories:</strong> Except solar, all merged into non-solar category including waste to energy.

</p>


<p><strong> B.7. Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission (HERC):</strong> Vide Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission (Terms and Conditions for determination of Tariff from Renewable Energy Sources, Renewable Purchase Obligation and Renewable Energy Certificate) Regulation, 2021 (2nd Amendment) Regulations, 2022 – Suo-motu Order, it amended Regulation 62 to provide for RPO trajectory till 2023-30 as under:</p>

            <img src="/img/blog1_11.png" alt="India’s Renewable Energy Landscape image" />

<p><strong>Different category targets:</strong> While the total RPO targets tally with what has been provided by the Central Government, neither the Wind RPO, Hydro targets nor Other RPO targets are in alignment.
</p>



<h2>Analysis and Observation</h2>

<p>
    The issue with the above overlap has been that there has been a cacophony of RPO targets and trajectory, both by virtue of overlap with legislative framework as well as internal inconsistencies in policy prescriptions by the Ministry of Power. Inconsistent RPOs will lead to a fragmented renewable energy market, where developers and investors face uncertainty about where to invest their resources, leading to obvious impediments in the growth of the renewable energy sector.
</p>
<p>
    While the State Commissions for the states of Maharashtra and Jharkhand have fully aligned their RPO targets with the Central Government trajectory, providing clarity and simplifying compliance, the State Commissions for the states of Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu have only aligned their overall RPO targets. Meanwhile, a few other State Commissions, such as those for the states of Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, and Odisha, have diversified their targets completely, reflecting regional priorities around renewable energy strategies.
</p>
<p>
    However, these differing targets and category definitions across states are likely to create confusion and necessitate clear guidelines for compliance, especially when they diverge. The divergence becomes a concern as the Energy Conservation Act, 2001, also stipulates separate penalties for breaches in meeting the RPO targets, in addition to penalties provided under the Regulations framed by different State Commissions. Section 26(3) of the Energy Conservation Act, 2001 (introduced via the Amendment Act of 2022) is extracted for ready reference as follows:
</p>
<p>
    “(3) If any person fails to comply with the directions issued under clauses (n) and (x) of section 14, he shall be liable to a penalty which shall not exceed ten lakh rupees for each such failure:
    <br>
    Provided that he shall also be liable to an additional penalty which shall not exceed twice the price of every metric ton of oil equivalent prescribed under this Act, which is in excess of the prescribed norms.”
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, it would be ideal if the Central Government refrains from prescribing RPO targets in view of the legal challenges outlined above and obviates any scope of confusion.
</p>




            <h2>IV. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>India’s renewable energy journey is not just a technological and economic challenge but also a legal one. Navigating this path requires upholding the principles of rule of law, ensuring that our pursuit of sustainable energy is firmly rooted in constitutional and statutory propriety. Addressing the legal and implementation challenges outlined above is crucial to ensure that renewable energy targets are met efficiently and effectively, without market fragmentation.</p>

        title: "APTEL: No Penalty for Uncontrollable Delays – HPCL vs. PNGRB",
        subtitle:"Penalty not to be imposed on developers.",
        date: "13 Dec 2024",
        author: "Sanjeev Singh Thakur",

        <p>
        The Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (Petroleum and Natural Gas Bench) directed Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (‘PNGRB/Board’) for refund of encashed Bank Guarantee amount to HPCL which PNGRB arbitrarily withheld, even after remand back of the order in the previous round of litigation. Further, APTEL interpreted reasonable time contemplated under Regulation 16(a) of the PNGRB (Authorising Entities to Lay, Build, Operate or Expand Petroleum and Petroleum Products Pipelines) Regulations, 2010 (‘Authorizing Regulations’) framed by the Board under the PNGRB Act, 2006 and the manner in which PNGRB is required to function in terms of Regulation 13. The provision laid down in Regulation 16 does not whip a developer with penalty for delay beyond its control. The conduct of PNGRB in imposing penalty was premature and violative of the relevant regulations read with the Act. APTEL observed that the Board has to put in place a robust mechanism of monitoring for effective and meaningful enforcement of Regulation 16.</p>

        <p>

The case involved HPCL, the Appellant, challenging the Order dated 06.03.2020 passed by the Board, whereby, the Appellant’s request for the refund of encashed Bank Guarantee was rejected by PNGRB. The PNGRB encashed the Appellant’s Bank Guarantee under Regulation 16. The Bank Guarantee which had been invoked was furnished by HPCL in relation to the authorization granted by the Board in favour of HPCL for laying, building, operating or expanding Uran-Chakan-Shikrapur LPG Pipeline (‘UCSPL Pipeline’).</p>

        <p>
Prior to the proceedings leading up to the decision in Order dated 06.03.2020, HPCL had also challenged the Board’s earlier Order dated 04.06.2016, vide Appeal No. 102 of 2016, wherein, the Hon’ble APTEL set aside the Order dated 04.06.2016, remanding the matter to the Board for taking a fresh decision within a period of four months. Pursuant to the Order passed by the Hon’ble APTEL in Appeal No. 102 of 2016, the Board initiated fresh proceedings on 22.09.2019.</p>

        <p>
On 08.03.2019, HPCL furnished the details of the status of completion of the project and requested the Board to extend the timeline of the project till August, 2019 and refund the encashed Bank Guarantee. The Board acceded to the request for extension of the project timeline till August, 2019 but refused to return the encashed Bank Guarantee stating that it will consider the prayer with respect to return of the Bank Guarantee after August, 2019. HPCL submitted a fresh letter of request to refund the Bank Guarantee on 03.01.2020 which was declined by the majority Order passed on 06.03.2020, under challenge in the present case.</p>

        <p>
In the present proceedings, Mr. Matrugupta Mishra, Advocate and Managing Partner, Ritam Legal argued the matter on behalf of HPCL. The Hon’ble APTEL, vide the present order, has observed that the objective of Regulation 16 is not to penalize an entity for delays beyond its control and therefore held that the Bank Guarantee amount becomes refundable when the previous Order dated 04.03.2016 of the Board was set aside by the Hon’ble APTEL’s judgment dated 09.01.2019 in Appeal No. 102 of 2016 and directed the Board to refund the encashed amount.</p>

<p>Scrolling through the Instagram early in the morning, while sitting on the thinking pot during the last day of the holiday, makes a startling revelation of the unavoidable menace, the monster that we created; and now, the monster and every component of it, is hovering a new threat.</p>

<p>A glimpse into the brief video made and uploaded by World Economic Forum[1], gives an insight and thousand questions as to the things viz. identification of the threat, evaluation of the threat and solution/ resolution of the threat.</p>

<p>I would choose not to go very elaborate with the literature, being verbose and rhetoric; I would restrain myself and stick to the hard numbers and the consequential requirements.</p>

<p>This piece is being written by me, apart from a burning issue, it attracted certain practical aspects, since my close association with the solid waste management industry along with renewable energy.</p>

<p>India being world’s 3rd largest producer and 4th largest consumer of natural rubber, generated around 169 million units of tyres in the FY ending 2021, which has witnessed a decrease by 4% from the preceding FY, though the industry forecast expected to grow to reach 218 million units by 2026. As a natural corollary, out of more than 1.5 billion units of waste tyres, India is contributing approx. 6%. It also imports around 3 lacs tons of tyres to recycle and disposal every year. Apart from that it also discards approx. 2,75,000 tyres every day.</p>

<p>A further research takes us to the order dated 19.09.2019 passed by NGT in OA No. 400/2019 with regard to the issue of absence of proper management of end of life tyres/ waste tyres as per the laws of the land and most specifically provisions of Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016. The alarming unauthorized and illegal use of waste tyres by the Pyrolysis Industry operating in the country, engaged in producing inferior quality pyrolysis oil, pyrolysis gas, solid residue (char) carbon black and steel through the pyrolysis process, were brought to the knowledge of the Tribunal. Concerned over making India a graveyard or dump-yard of highly polluting hazardous waste material, it at once warned CPCB and other authorities to regulate and restrict import of waste tyres for recycling.</p>

<p>Further, vide order dated 25.10.2021, other suggestions were made by NGT. As an offshoot of which my attention was drawn to a draft Regulation on Extended Producer Responsibility for Waste Tyres, 2021[2], by virtue of which obligations have been laid down on the producers as well as recyclers of waste tyre for registration and other compliances. Under the draft regulation, the manufacturers and importers of new tyres were given the responsibility of waste tyre recycling target in percentage form, year-wise. The import of waste tyre for the purpose of producing pyrolysis oil/ char is completely prohibited. The producers are under obligation to fulfil its EPR obligation through online purchase of EPR certificate from registered recyclers. The modus operandi of EPR Certificate Generation is also provided under the Regulation. A violation of the requirements under the Regulations would entail environmental compensation.</p>

<p>The waves of questions emerged by an insight into the issues are definitely not satiated vide the concerns of NGT coupled with status report submitted by CPCB, directions of NGT and a draft Regulation for EPR, which is yet to be notified.</p>

<p>An integrated approach is the only way forward and probably that is what the constituent assembly envisaged while borrowing DPSP (Chapter IV) from Irish Constitution, further insertion of Article 48-A by the Parliament, with the Supreme Court and the High Courts of the country playing a vanguard role in protecting the environment through the routes of statutes or vide the conundrum of right to life and personal liberty, under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.</p>

<p>Apart from the Regulations being in force with the precaution of registration, proclamation of consent, redemption of certificates and the deterrence of imposition of penalty/ compensation, incentivization of the industries for recycling and a road map of the finish products along with process technology are required to be in place. Vide a detailed policy decision, Government of India to ensure, so that the next level of environmental crisis can be nipped by adhering to the best technology available with least hazardous and most useful end use in the form of recycling of tyres.</p>

<p>A consumption-intensive economy apart from incentivizing and promoting manufacturing, shall have to parallelly establish an all-pervasive scientifically processed recycling industry, else the waste or the consequential hazard of the waste, would subsume the ‘generate’.</p>
